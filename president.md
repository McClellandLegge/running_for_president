# Who's running for President?

When looking at [FEC data](http://fec.gov/data/CandidateSummary.do?format=html), I noticed that

- there are a _lot_ of people running for President, and
- some of them have absurd, obviously fake names.  

Of course I wanted to share my delight in finding  

- four Jesuses,
- four Satans,
- Mickey Mouse (of course),
- Cobra Commander,
- Rocky Balboa,
- Dank Ass Weed,
- Dat Phat A$$,
- Buddy the Elf (who lives at the North Pole),  

and many, many more ludicrous and wonderful names have been submitted to and processed by some person or computer working for our government as legitimate candidates for the highest office in the land. However, a social media post could simply not contain the delight in discovering the next ridiculosity on the list, so I did the only logical thing, and made you a webpage. Enjoy!

# Notes

- Type whatever occurs to you into the search box on the Data tab, and have a chuckle.
- Check out the map to find out who from your town is running for President...probably somebody. Click on a cluster to zoom in and get more information.
- I tried to plot candidate addresses on the map, but obviously trying to locate "Shit, Fuck AL 11111" is probably not going to work (and sometimes Google's geocoder just fails), so some of the markers are in strange places or missing.
- - As the data is from the FEC, it includes candidate financial information (where available). It dates from 30 April 2016, so is not particularly useful in comparing current fundraising totals, if you care about such things.
- Data is courtesy of [the FEC](http://fec.gov/data/CandidateSummary.do?format=html); geocoding by Google.
- Source code is available on [my Github](https://github.com/alistaire47/running_for_president). This website was built using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), and [Datatables](https://datatables.net/).
