# Who's running for President?


This is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) website to display FEC data on who is running for President of the United States in the 2016 election (a lot more people than you think).  

Coded in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), leveraging packages for the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) JavaScript libraries.
